# ITM411_FinalProject
Program Description

This project is about creating a help desk trouble ticket system. In this project we create different tickets for different failures and malfunctions causing trouble in a system. The tickets will be open if the failure is still persisting and closed if the problem has been resolved.
Trouble Ticket systems help you to get full control over any given trouble tickets. You can monitor trouble tickets effectively and improve the IT services you provide. These tickets are so called because of their origin as small cards within a traditional wall mounted work planning system when this kind of support started.  Operators or staff receiving a call or query from a user would fill out a small card with the user's details and a brief summary of the request and place it into a position  in a column of pending slots for an appropriate engineer, so determining the staff member who would deal with the query and the priority of the request.
